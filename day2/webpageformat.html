    </center>
    <p>
      Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi
      Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks
      recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader
      of his village. The story is told in two parts: the first is set in
      Naruto's pre-teen years , and the second in his teens . The series is
      based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned
      Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the
      following year, and Naruto (1997)

    <h2>introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Naruto is one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having 250
      million copies in circulation worldwide in 47 countries and regions, with
      153 million copies in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies
      elsewhere. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series;
      their English translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and
      The New York Times bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume
      won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's character
      development, storylines, and action sequences, though some felt the latter
      slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a
      coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references from Japanese
      mythology and Confucianism

    <h2>Plot:</h2>
    <p>
      A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf
      village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in
      the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage,
      Minato Namikaze, at the cost of his life, seals the fox inside the body of
      his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making him a host of the beast

    <h3>part 1</h3>
    <p>
      The Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the leader of Konoha
      again. Naruto is often scorned by Konoha's villagers for being the host of
      the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the Third Hokage forbidding any mention
      of these events, Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years
      later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to him. Naruto
      defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher, Iruka
      Umino.[ii] Shortly afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke
      Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and Sakura Haruno, on whom he has
      a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja
      Kakashi Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7
      completes missions requested by the villagers, ranging from doing chores
      and being bodyguards to performing assassinations. After several missions,
      including a major one in the Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take
      a ninja exam, enabling them to advance to a higher rank and take on more
      difficult missions, known as Chunin Exams.

    <h3>part 2</h3>
    <p>
      Two and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with Jiraiya.
      The Akatsuki starts kidnapping the hosts of the powerful Tailed Beasts.
      Team 7 and other Leaf ninja fight against them and search for their
      teammate Sasuke. The Akatsuki succeeds in capturing and extracting seven
      of the nine Tailed Beasts, killing all the hosts except Gaara, who is now
      the Kazekage. Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and faces Itachi to
      take revenge. After Itachi dies in battle, Sasuke learns from the Akatsuki
      founder Tobi that Itachi had been ordered by Konoha's superiors to destroy
      his clan to prevent a coup; he accepted, on the condition that Sasuke
      would be spared. Devastated by this revelation, Sasuke joins the Akatsuki
      to destroy Konoha in revenge. As Konoha ninjas defeat several Akatsuki
      members, the Akatsuki figurehead leader, Nagato, kills Jiraiya and
      devastates Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems him, earning the
      village's respect and admiration. . .

    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <p>
      When he created Naruto, Kishimoto looked to other shōnen manga as
      influences for his work and tried to make his characters unique, while
      basing the story on Japanese culture.[11] The separation of the characters
      into different teams was intended to give each group a particular flavor.
      Kishimoto wanted each member to have a high level of aptitude in one skill
      and be talentless in another.[12] He found it difficult to write about
      romance, but emphasized it more in Part II of the manga, beginning with
      volume 28.[8] He introduced villains into the story to have them act as a
      counterpoint to his characters' moral values and clearly illustrate their
      differences.[13] As a result of how the younger characters were
      significantly weaker than the villains, Kishimoto made the ellipsis in
      order to have them age and become stronger during this time.[14]

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Masashi Kishimoto's home was close to Hiroshima where his grandfather
      lived. He would often tell his grandson stories of war and how it was
      related to grudges. In retrospect, Kishimoto commented he could not
      criticize anyone as a result of the war based on it was
      built.[clarification needed] Upon further researching, Kishimoto decided
      to create world war story arc for the manga's finale. However, unlike the
      stories he heard from his grandfather, Kishimoto wanted to give the war
      covered in Naruto a more hopeful feeling.[17] Nagato's arc paved the way
      for the ending of Naruto to occur. Nagato stood out as a villain due to
      suffering war and killing Naruto's mentor Jiraiya. Understanding the fears
      of war, Naruto's characterization was made more complex for him to
      experience the Fourth Great Shinobi War. These events end with Naruto
      forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato in the final battle.[14]

    <h4>Manga</h4>
    <p>
      Naruto was scanlated (translated by fans) and available online before a
      licensed version was released in North America;[35] the rights were
      acquired by Viz Media, who began serializing Naruto in their anthology
      comic magazine Shonen Jump, starting with the January 2003 issue.[36] The
      schedule was accelerated at the end of 2007 to catch up with the Japanese
      version,[37] and again in early 2009, with 11 volumes (from 34 to 44)
      appearing in three months, after which it returned to a quarterly
      schedule.[38] All 27 volumes of Part I were released in a boxed set on
      November 13, 2007.[39] On May 3, 2011, Viz started selling the manga in an
      omnibus format with each book containing three volumes
