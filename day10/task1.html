        <p style="color: blue;">One of the best parts about the winter season in India is the fact that it brings along a bountiful of fresh seasonal produce with it. Vegetables and fruits that are available during this season have their own charm. Out of that gamut, red carrots (gajar), green peas (matar) and cauliflower (phool gobi) happen to be my top picks. I have shared a healthy and delicious Cauliflower Curry in this post, which is best made with the winter gobi.</p>

        <p>Wild potato species can be found from the southern United States to southern Chile. Genetic studies show that the cultivated potato has a single origin, in the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia. Potatoes were domesticated there about 7,000â€“10,000 years ago from a species in the S. brevicaule complex. Many varieties of the potato are cultivated in the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous.</p>
